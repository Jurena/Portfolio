			<p id="larger-text" class="text-left">I've always loved to construct and build systems from scratch as a means of understanding how things work. I grew up looking at the world with a lot of curiosity and wonder, especially when it came to technology; I even went as far as building computers throughout high school! After my first year of college, I switched out of my first major, Computer Engineering, because I felt like something was missing. I enrolled in Integrated Digital Media and I found a passion for doing work within and examining media. College also introduced me to what it means to be a leader, as I took advantage of opportunities like becoming a Teaching Assistant, a Special Projects Student Assistant at my campus library, and a representative for peers during my time as the school Senator. These roles have allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of my institution, and they’ve challenged me to tackle projects that help students within the classroom and increase student engagement. Within whatever job I am in, I seek to get involved in my institution and use my skills to work within a team that creates amazing products and services that people can use every day and safely rely on.</p>
